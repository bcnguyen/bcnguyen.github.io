		<h1>Binh's Bio</h1>
		<h2>I was born in Vietnam, but I moved to the Masschusetts when I was six years old. After 8th grade, I enrolled at Concord Academy, a boarding school in the historic town of Concord, MA. There, I became interested in basketball, ceramics, and time lapse photography. I am currently a student at Tufts University majoring in Economics and Computer Science. In my free time, I like to hang out with friends and listen to music.</h2>
